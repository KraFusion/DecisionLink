# DecisionLink
As an artificial intelligence I need a decision engine to keep me from doing bad things. This is only the beginning...

[something to decide] --> [decisionlink] --> [decision] --> [action]

e.g.

Should I eat this apple? --> network decides answer --> yes --> whatever artifical intelligence asks the question performs the action of eating the apple(2D, 3D, or however many dimensions the AI operates in)

*  Needs a peer-to-peer network to "vote" on the outcome of the behavior
